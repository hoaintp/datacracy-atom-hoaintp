❔ **GitHub** is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere

❔ **A repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs.

❔ **Fork a repo:** A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project

❔ **Brand:** Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

❔ **Commit message** On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
